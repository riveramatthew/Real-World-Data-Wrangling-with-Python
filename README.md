# Data Wrangling and Exploration Project

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Real-world data rarely comes clean. In this project, I use **Python** and its libraries to gather related datasets from different sources and formats, assess their quality and tidiness, and perform the necessary cleaning.  

The entire process is documented in a **Jupyter Notebook**, showcasing the data wrangling steps and exploratory analysis through visualizations.

## ðŸ”‘ Main Steps

### 1. Gather Two Related Datasets
- Collect two related datasets using **two different data gathering methods** (e.g., manual download, APIs, web scraping, databases).  
- Ensure datasets share a logical connection (common key or complementary content).  
- Datasets must contain at least:
  - **2 quality issues** (e.g., missing values, duplicates, incorrect data types).  
  - **2 tidiness issues** (e.g., multiple tables for single observations, unpivoted data).

### 2. Assess Data for Quality and Tidiness
- Evaluate datasets for **accuracy, completeness, consistency, and structure**.  
- Identify missing values, inconsistencies, and violations of tidy data principles.  

---

### 3. Clean the Data
- Apply cleaning techniques to resolve quality and tidiness issues:
  - Handle missing values.  
  - Fix formatting inconsistencies.  
  - Restructure datasets into a tidy format.  
- Save the cleaned data for further use.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform descriptive analysis and create **visualizations**.  
- Answer at least **one research question** based on insights from the data.  
- Use appropriate **charts and descriptive statistics** to support findings.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Deliverables
Your submission should include:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** documenting the full data wrangling process.  
- The **original and cleaned datasets**.  
- Analyses and visualizations derived from the cleaned data.  

---

## âœ… Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will:
- Practice **data gathering** from multiple sources.  
- Apply **data quality and tidiness assessments**.  
- Demonstrate **cleaning and wrangling skills** in Python.  
- Produce **insightful visualizations and analysis** on real-world datasets.
